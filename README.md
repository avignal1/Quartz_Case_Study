# Quartz Case Study
## Bank of America Leveraging FinTech Technology
## Andrew and Arthur
### Deep Dive of Client and Regulatory Needs
1. What is the background of your company? What do they do? Who are their competitors?
   Quartz is Bank of Americas Merrill Lynch's integrated trading, position management, pricing and risk management platform. Many other investmeent banks have their own internal platforms, such as Goldman Sachs SecDB and JPMorgan's Athena. 

2. How does this company use technology to their advantage? Why are they considered a FinTech company?
   Companies use this technology to their advantage by managing their risk exposures and sharing information across functions and teams, as opposed to being siloed (stand-alone). Additionally, Quartz helps BoA meet its regualatory requests. Historically, BoA is not considered a FinTech, but changing client and regulatory expectations have pushed BoA to develop Quartz as a way to satify those client demands (meeting regulatory requests and rolling out new financial products, etc.)

3. Why is this company exemplary in the FinTech space? What are their strengths and weaknesses?
   Quartz is exemplary because it leverages Python language, the most popular and well known language used by developers. An obvious strength is that it uses Python, and additionally it allows for mulitple developes globally to access and create solutions to the potential problems that arise, by using the same dataset and langauge (as opposed to previous stand alone platforms). A potential weakness for using Quartz is finding individuals with the required Python coding ability as well as banking and financial product knowledge to fully utilize the platform.

4. What is the prognosis for this company? Where do they expect to be in the future?
   Quartz has set BoA up for success in the future. In the future, Quartz can provide flexibility to meet future client demands and increased regulatory expectation.
